# Testing

Django query preparer has unit and integration tests in `test_app/` which is a Django application bundled in this repo to provide the scaffolding needed to run the tests.

To run the unit tests you need to have docker and docker-compose installed. Then simply do:

```
docker-compose up
```

in the base directory.
